Non Non S1 EP3
Today is our trip.  
Older sister I can help out.   what do you need done?
Make 2 onigiri.  I wonder if you can do it right. [TN: onigiri = riceball]
Leave it to me.  
Looks tasty.  
Thanks. 
I only have one older sister, but she's short.  But regarding that we can't help it.  
Therefore consider it before hand.  
Alright, Russian onigiri.  
What!?
Only one mustard shall be put on.  And so that's the end of discussion.
What's with these wise words?
The weather is nice.  This is ideal weather for our trip.  
Natsumi-senpai? What is it?
What are you going about? Today's the trip.  
I did not hear anything about a trip.  
Only Natsumi and I went.  My older sister and Hotaru didn't tell the teacher.  
On the hand, trip! fun!  The rice field picking* festival will now begin. Today you'll be helping me picking the things in the rice field.  Thanks for help on working on my rice field.   That's wrong, since you're doing a part time job and I have no money to pay you.  I know it's a pain to help me, so you're not being stupid for helping me out.  It'll be fun  and our rice is precious.  You can draw a picture at the classroom.* the trip's news is that you that don't do anything that will make me mad.  I forgot to mention that yesterday.  Natsumi got hurt.  Ren-chon came to fun during this trip right?
Really I'll join you. 
Yes, and moving on, time to start the rice picking*.  
We have to break this season down by hand.  We can't help that.  We'll eat our bentos and go home.  
I didn't bring a bento with me.  
You can eat the onigiri.  We'll give you the ones that we made.  
Senpai made those onigiri? I'll do my best.  
Alright.  up and attem.  
Stop! As long as they're not up, we win.  My wish is to be able to settle off and have no worries.  
Amazing, sending cheer*
hmm? what's this?
"I wanted to go to an amusement park! I wanted to go to a zoo! I wanted to go to an aquarium! At least a local one-car train!"
No I just don't get it.  Hey older brother.  I can picture him rising.  I expected this to be not so interesting.  
Hey Natsumi
I can't help you right now.
I can't move in the mud.  
What? what? How do you get trapped in the middle of plants?
Stop laughing and help me.  
I can't help it.   Therefore I am worried by those I live with.  
You body is like a yellow jacktail?
A yellow jacktail is an animal.  
Hotaru! Hotaru rescue me!
Onigiri, senpai's onigiri.  
All you have to give is the onigiri.  
She likes the onigiri.  I have no choice but to rescue my older sister at home.  
What are you going to do now?
I'll entrust that an earthquake will happen.*  
I have no other choice.  I told you not to do the full nelson.*  
You can't do anything either
Where's our excited teacher?
I finally have an opportunity to myself.  These guys don't know what kind of opportunity this is.   
Fine let's go.  
I'll eat my bento then go.  
What about the food you promised me?
of course, a promise is a promise.  Here.  
Tasty.  
Hotaru, you like onigiri don't you?
Tasty!
restrain yourself!
What a blunder that was. 
Older sister cheer up.  You haven't do anything.  
Shut up! this is your fault.  
What are you watching?
rental video about healing and love making  
tomorrow.  we'll see a weird agreement between the sister in law.  
Returning the favor is trouble isn't it? the other party is benefitting huh? This time's it's sickness wide spreading.  
No way.  Wisconsin's population has been completely obliterated.  
That ebb and flow was convenient.  I'm glad for the funny callout.  
I'm going to bed.  Today made so tired.  Using the rest of what I got to sleep.  So convenient aren't you older sister?    You sure are quiet and scared.  
I forgot.  I'll be alright.  The child laid there like a doll.  
Alright then good night.  
Alright 14 then?*
Why did you come into my room? Your room is next door.  
My room is a bit too noisy.  
You know, your room is next door.  I can't help it.  I'll sleep in your room.  
Are you afraid?
I'm not afraid.  I'm just asking.  
There's a ghost behind you older sister.  
There was a not a possession.  
Your face showed fear.  You face looked like you've seen a ghost.  It's alright.  You can do it.  My eye hurts.* 
Alright stop crying and go to sleep.  oh and turn on the light.  
what light?
The mini light.  
you can't sleep without it huh? 
I wonder if we have that trashcan lying around?  Older sister if you're scared of the dark, why not turn on the light? 
It's not that I'm afraid, but it's that I have to find your favorite plushie.  
I'm not scared, but the goal of that was to showcase.*
Wait a second.  Sorry to keep you waiting.  
What's wrong older sister? Is that all you got?  I thought you had more.*  That was scary.
Shut up! you idiot! Go away! 
Now now, Koma-chan , now what will you do?
Choji-san is? [TN: name of her plushie. ] 
Why do you have my plushie? 
I told you it was in the garbage.  
You could at least apologize.  
Oh yeah I can hear voices coming from the front.  Darkness, the words of an old man* here's your plushie back.  
it's dark.  
You're really a scaredy cat huh? aren't you older sister.  
What's with the top? 
No more ghosts please.  Not again.  I can't see anything.  
Ghosts, spirits, and other such are nothing to be afraid of.  Oh, ghosts and spirits died right? Wait older sister, ghosts and spirits have to have died first right? 
Ghosts aren't real.  
Ehh..Wake up older sister wake up. 
Oh is Natsumi late? 
She couldn't sleep.  
There are items that would break that my older sister loves and would marry.  
For example
Therefore this house isn't harmony.  Stray cats run around here.  
, cats that look alike roam around here daily.  
Lately, there have been two frolicing  in the back woods*.  Older sister also saw them.  You saw it right? 
Is that true? Komari! Are you trying to say no?
Wrong!
Older sister what are you doing?  Oh yeah the cat is really crazy*.  
crazy? Show me this cat during dinner.  I really have no idea what you two are talking about.  
Why can't you believe your own kids?
your persistence  is really negative.  However instead of running for comfort, try to live life.  
but lately 
you're the only person who got a 0 on their test
but that's a lie.  
you never clean your room.  should be punished.  
that I can't help.  
the main point is that you don't take things seriously.  
what the? you as well.  fine older sister let's go.  
wait a minute.  
dumbass.  
I'm your parent, what the hell? 
ha hah you're not the boss of me now.
Natsumi, you dumbass.  I didn't want to go.  
The main point is that she doesn't want to take life seriously.  
what will we do now?  
we'll go down the road  opposite of hidden tactics 
this road is the hidden road?
good morning fish
wait a second.  
We can smell this tunnel.  
I don't want to climb this tunnel.  
These are things mom left behind.  We can rest here.  
Are you serious?
This place has no lighting.  
make yourself at home.  
If I sit here my skirt will get ruined.  
don't worry about it.  
I'll make you feel at home older sister.  
Missing lines from 16:51-17:00
we should play a game of shiritori in our spare time.  [TN: shiritori = Japanese word-chain game.]

That's an interesting time to hang out.  
apple

I never thought I'd put my sister in her place in a game of Shiritori.  
Fine then.  
I'm starving. 
What did you bring to eat older sister?
The things I do for you.  
I have this candy bar that I bought yesterday.  
yay Older sister!  Can I have half?
I can't help it. 
hmm tasty.  
I remember now.  
You drew this picture when you were little.   When you and mom were in an argument, you came here and drew this.  I couldn't forget that.  
That's not exactly what happened.  
I'm hungry.  So want to eat that weird old lad? feel bad don't you?

though what to do.?
Natsumi hang in there! The house is only a bit further.  
Natsumi!

Look at that!
Wait! what are you planning on doing? 
I plan on dragging the cat to mom.  
wait a second
It's not running?
it became a bit cold.  
let's go home.
Is mom here?
I don't know
anyways, we shouldn't linger outside.

There were cats and older sister got a little too into 
natsumi, don't stab with the chopsticks.  Komari, don't eat and talk at the same time.  
pardon my intrusion.

that's not a good feeling.  
Line missing at 22:00
There's plenty around the house.  
Like a reflection of one another. 
That's nothing special.  
Becoming attached to me is bad.
