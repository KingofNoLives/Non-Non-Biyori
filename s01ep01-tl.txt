Non Non S1 EP 1 Script:
This place is my village.
It's quiet and peaceful.
Sometimes I think...
Where we live here...
Ren-chon!
...is the sticks.
Mornin'!
What was that?
Nyanpasu~!
I dunno what that means. What did you say?
Nyan...pasu~!
Nyan...pasu...
What about Koma-chan?
Oh, she left earlier.
The weather is so perfect! But we have school today...
I'm a brand-new first grader so I think it will be fun!
It's not exactly fun.
School life is tough you know.
It's all homework, tests, and more homework.
For breakfast, we had miso soup with horsetail shoots.
We had egg soup with horsetail shoots and onions.
Run, Ren-chon!
Regne! Natsumi!
Nee-chan!
Nattsun, did you watch the news today?
Oh, no, I didn't. I was in a hurry.
I didn't see it either.
Too bad. Today's news was pretty exciting.
Did something happen?
Outside the window behind the host, there was this old guy doing radio calisthenics.
It was very cool.
Why is that exciting to you?
Man, it's kind of cold.
Today, the classroom feels different than yesterday.
What?
Mornin'!
Take your seats.
Um...
Why don't you introduce yourself?
Ichijou...
Text: Ichijou Hotaru.
Ah, um...Ichijou Hotaru. I'm from Tokyo.
Whoa! From Tokyo?!
That says "Hotaru"?
First time I've seen that character.
What grade?
Fifth.
Younger? She's younger than me?!
She doesn't look like a fifth grader.
Hey, did you do something bad at your last school?
No, it's because of my father's work.
What! Oh, the usual, then...
Nyanpasu~!
Nya-nyan...
Take a seat.
Alright.
Oh, yeah. There's an extra seat.
You just realized?
Nice to meet you, Hotarun.
Hotarun...
What was first period again?
Japanese.
Ah, everyone is in different grades?
I'm in first.
I'm in eighth.
I'm in the seventh, and Nii-chan's in ninth.
You're all in the same classroom?
Yeah.
What do you mean different classes? This is the only class.
The whole school is just four students?
With you, Hotarun, it's five people.
Since we're all in different grades,
we mostly study on our own.
On your own?
Didn't you get a workbook?
Oh! Yeah I did!
Now then, what should we do?
Hm, I...
Dodgeball! I wanna play dodgeball!
Dodgeball huh?
Um...I was wondering on my way to class...
what are the buckets for?
Ah, they're for catching leaks.
So, don't get too close to them.
Oh I see.
It would be annoying if a bucket got moved and we couldn't find the leak again.
Nah, that's not it.
The floor's rotting from the moisture.
If you get close, you'll fall through.
Huh?!
Just kidding, just kidding!
So far, no one has been stupid enough to fall in.
Yeah, so just be careful.
I see.
Here I go!
Take this!
Ahh yikes!
Eh?
Hotarun!
Oof!
Hotarun. Out!
I shouldn't have tried to catch it...
There's a key on the ground!
A key? For what?
What's the matter?
Well, no one is going to be home until tonight,
so I brought my house key.
Ren-chon, do you lock your house?
Nuh-uh.
Nee-chan, we don't lock our doors either, do we?
I've never seen a lock before.
I see...
You're strange.
Wait, what else would I lock...?
Maybe mackerel? (Note: Shime means both lock and prepare with vinegar)
We're done! We're done!
Hurry, let's get home.
Hotarun!
Want to hang out at our house?
You don't wanna?
Ah, okay.
Well, just for a little bit.
These are mandarin orange trees.
The new blossoms are coming out.
The leaves, the type you garnish food with?
You grow mandarin oranges?
And rice and vegetables, mostly.
Oh, and leaves.
Leaves?
Like garnish for food.
Um, do you have any stores?
There is a co-op and a candy store.
Uh, anything else?
The police box?
That's not a store.
Is there a bookstore?
The candy store sells magazines.
But only two days late.
Convenience stores...none of those either?
I've seen some commercials about them!
Cattle?
Sometimes deer, too.
Boars too.
What's wrong?
This place is just...so different from Tokyo.
So it's still too early to put away the kotatsu...
Hey, did you notice that the door wasn't locked?
Yes.
Today, mom and dad are working in the fields.
Nee-chan, grab that for me...
Jeez, can't you grab it yourself?
Here.
Ah, thank you, thank you.
What's up, Ren-chon?
I'm gonna show Hotarun my talent!
There's no sound coming out.
Still no sound coming out.
Whoa! Something came out!
A tanuki!
You keep a tanuki?
And the tanuki actually heard you?
I named it too.
What kind of name?
Gu!
Oh! A psychedelic name!
Gu will do a trick if I whistle again!
Whoa!
The whistling made a noise this time!
What will Gu do?!
Ren-chon!
Good morning!
Ren-chon?
Nattsun...
Do we really live in the sticks?
Where is this coming from?
Hotarun was really surprised.
Having different grades in one classroom, and the tanuki...
Nee-nee told me if you drive 50 kilometers per hour
you'll be somewhere fifty kilometers away in an hour,
and that's really awesome.
I...see now.
By the way, if you travel 50 kilometers per hour,
you can't go somewhere 50 kilometers away because of traffic lights.
Oh yeah...I knew that.
But even in Tokyo, there's gotta be
classrooms that combine elementary and middle school students,
even if they're in different rooms.
And the highway doesn't have traffic lights.
So it's not like we live in the sticks!
Hotarun, hello!
Morning!
nyanpasu~
Good morning!
Ren-chon?
But since a tanuki lives at my house, we must live in the sticks...
You're still talking about that?
What are we talking about?
Whether or not this place is really the sticks.
Is this really the sticks?
If you think about it logically...
Just because you live here doesn't mean it's the sticks.
That already makes you sound like a country girl.
Nah, even in Tokyo, monkeys show up every now and then.
Just because a tanuki shows up, doesn't mean this is the sticks, right?
Right?
Ah...
You don't want this to be the sticks, do you?
If living in the sticks means doing anything is inconvenient,
just having cattle and tanuki doesn't make things inconvenient, right?
So, this isn't the sticks!
I see now.
So...this isn't the sticks.
I feel better.
I'm glad, I'm glad! You're a good girl!
Let's eat!
Today's dishes were made with the vegetables that we picked.
Horsetail shoots, wild udo, and tara sprouts.
Delicious!
It kind of tastes like spring!
Hotarun. Save your sakura mochi desert.
How far are we going?
Almost there, almost there!
Hotarun!
Tasty, isn't it?
Yeah, it's good!
We'll come back again.
Waaaiiit!
We were too slow, weren't we...
By the way, when's the next bus?
In two hours.
Huh?!
Man...buses in the sticks sure are inconvenient.
I knew it!
