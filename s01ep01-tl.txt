Non Non S1 EP 1 Script:
This place is my village.
It's quiet and peaceful.
Sometimes I think...
Where we live here...
Ren-chon!
...is the sticks. (Editor: she says 田舎 「いなか」, which is a somewhat insensitive way to say countryside, kind of like "the sticks" or "the middle of nowhere")
Mornin'! (Editor: The お is barely audible hence "Morning" instead of "Good morning")
What was that?
Nyanpasu~!
I dunno what that means. What did you say? (Editor: She says わかな which suggests "dunno" rather than "don't know")
Nyan...pasu~!
Nyan...pasu...
What about Koma-chan?
Oh, she left earlier.
The weather is so perfect! But we have school today...
I'm excited to be a brand-new first grader! (Editor: She uses ピカピカ suggesting shiny, brand new, etc.)
It's not exactly fun. School life is tough with all the homework, tests, and more homework.
For breakfast, we had miso with horsetail shoots.
We had egg soup with horsetail shoots and onions.
We need to hurry, Ren-chon!
Regne Natsumi
older sister.
Did you watch the news today?
I didn't. I was in a hurry.
I didn't.
Too bad. It was pretty exciting.
Did something happen?
There was this guy outside the window who was imitating the host.
It was cool.
Why is that exciting to you?
It's a bit cold in here.
The classroom feels different today.
What?
Morning! Take your seats. Introduce yourself, would you?
Ichijou Hotaru.
Ichijou Hotaru.  I'm from Tokyo.
Awesome!
That's read "Hotaru"?
I've never seen that character before.
What grade are you in?
Fifth.
Younger? She's younger than me?!
She doesn't look like a fifth grader.
Did you cause trouble at your past school?
It was because of my father's work.
Oh, well then...
Nyanpasu~!
Nyan...
Sit here.
Nice to meet you, Hotarun.
What was first period again?
Japanese.
Everyone is in different grades?
I'm in first grade.
I'm in eighth.
I'm in the seventh, and he's in ninth.
Why are you in the same classroom?
Different classes? This is the only class.
Since we're different classes, we mostly study on our own.
Didn't you get a workbook?
There are only 4 students in the whole school?
What should we do?
We should play dodgeball!
Dodgeball huh?
Um, I was wondering what the buckets were for?
They're for catching leaks.
it would be a problem if a bucket got moved and we could not identify the source of the leak.
no that's why.
that was a joke.
Take care
I see.
Here I go.
ahh really?
Hotaru!
Hotaru out!
there's a key on the ground?
a key?
There will be no one home tonight?
Ren-chon, do you lock our house door?
Big sister did you lock the door?
I've never seen a lock
I see.
You're strange.
we're done
hurry let's go home
Hotarun, want to hang out at our house? You won't come?
Fine, just for a little while though.
These are orange trees.
The new blossoms are growing?
The leaves, the type you garnish food with?
The store is where?
There is a co-op and a candy store.
Anymore?
the police box?
That's not a store.
Is there a bookstore?
The candy store sells magazines.
There is no convenience stores.
I've seen some commercials about them.
cows?
sometimes deer.
what's wrong?
This place is different from Tokyo.
Notice that the door was unlocked.
Today mom and dad are working.
Old sister, please grab for that me.
You should grab it yourself.
What's wrong ren-chon?
No sound is coming out.
No sound is still coming out.
Something came out.
A raccoon came out.
You own a raccoon? And it actually heard that noise?
I named it too.
What kind of name?
Gu
A psychedelic name
Gu will do a trick if I whistle again.
The whistling made a noise this time.
Gu will do?
Ren-chon
morning.
Ren-chon?
Do we live in the country side?
Where is this coming from?
Hotarun was  surprised by the raccoon, having different grades in one classroom.
My older sister told me you drive 50 km an hour, you drive 50 km in an hour.  It is amazing.
I see.
in one hour, you can't travel 50 km due to traffic lights.
In tokyo, there are some classrooms that combine elementary and middle school students.  There are no traffic lights.
Hotarun hello
good morning
nyanpasu~
hello
Ren-chon?
A raccoon lives at my house.  I think we live in the country.
You're still talking about that.
what are you talking about?
Is this really the country?
if you think about it logically.
Just because you live here does not make you a country girl.
that already makes you sound like a country girl.
You don't want this to be country do you?
If living in the country means you can't do anything, just having things like cows and raccoons doesn't make it inconvenient as well.  This isn't the countryside.
I see now. This is not the country.
Excellent, you're a good kid.
time to eat.
today's dishes were made with the vegetables that we picked.  Horsetail shoots,  wild udo, and tara sprouts.
it's tasty.
It tastes like spring.
Hotaru, save your blossom desert.
where are we going?
just a little further.
wait a second.....!!!
we were too slow.
when can we catch the next bus?
in two hours
what?
the buses are sure inconvenient.
Alright then!
