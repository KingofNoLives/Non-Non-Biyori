Non Non S1 EP 1 Script:
This place is my village. 
It's quiet and peaceful.
But sometimes I think...
Where we live...
Ren-chon!
...is the sticks. (Editor: she says 田舎 「いなか」, which is a somewhat insensitive way to say countryside, kind of like "the sticks" or "the middle of nowhere")

Title: 転校生がきた (A New Transfer Student) 一話 (Episode 1)

Mornin'! (Editor: The お is barely audible hence "Morning" instead of "Good morning")
What was that?
Nyanpasu~!
I dunno what that means. What did you say? (Editor: She says わかな which suggests "dunno" rather than "don't know")
Nyan...pasu~!
Nyan...pasu...
What about Koma-chan?
Oh, she left earlier.
The weather is so perfect! But we have school today...
I'm a brand-new first grader so I think it will be fun! (Editor: She uses ピカピカ suggesting shiny, brand new, etc.)
It's not going to be fun for long.
School life is tough you know.
It's all homework, tests, and more homework.
For breakfast, we had miso soup with horsetail shoots.
We had egg soup with horsetail shoots and onions.
Run, Ren-chon!
Renge! Natsumi!
Nee-chan!
Nattsun, did you watch the news today?
Oh, no, I didn't. I was in a hurry.
I didn't see it either.
Too bad. Today's news was pretty exciting.
Did something happen?
Outside the window behind the host, there was this old guy doing radio calisthenics.
It was very cool.
Why is that exciting to you?
Man, it's still a bit cold.
Today, the classroom feels different than yesterday.
What?
Mornin!
Take your seats.
Um...
Why don't you introduce yourself?
Ichijou...
Text: Ichijou Hotaru.
Ah, um...Ichijou Hotaru. I'm from Tokyo.
Whoa! From Tokyo?!
That says "Hotaru"?
First time I've seen that character.
What grade?
Fifth.
Younger? She's younger than me?!
She doesn't look like a fifth grader.
Hey, did you do something bad at your last school?
No, it's because of my father's work.
What! Oh, the usual, then...
Nyanpasu~!
Nya-nyan...
Take a seat.
Alright.
Oh, yeah. There's an extra seat.
You just realized?
Nice to meet you, Hotarun.
Hotarun...
What was first period again?
Japanese.
Ah, everyone is in different grades?
I'm in first.
I'm in eighth.
I'm in the seventh, and Nii-chan's in ninth.
You're all in the same classroom?
Yeah.
Every class?
What do you mean different classes? This is the only class.
The whole school is just four students?
It's five now with you, Hotarun. [QC/TC: I thought this sounded better]
Since we're all in different grades,
it's mostly self-study.
Self-study?
Didn't you get a workbook?
Oh! Yeah I did!
Now then, what should we do?
Hm, I...
Dodgeball! I wanna play dodgeball!
Dodgeball huh?
Um...I was wondering on my way to class...
what are the buckets for?
Ah, they're for catching leaks.
So, don't get too close to them.
Oh I see.
It would be annoying if a bucket got moved and we couldn't find the leak again.
Nah, that's not it.
The floor's rotting from the moisture.
If you get close, you'll fall through.
Huh?!
Just kidding, just kidding!
So far, no one has been stupid enough to fall in.
Yeah, so just be careful.
Take care
I see.
Here I go.
ahh really?
Hotaru!
Hotaru out!
there's a key on the ground?
a key?
There will be no one home tonight?
Ren-chon, do you lock our house door?
Big sister did you lock the door?
I've never seen a lock
I see.
You're strange.
we're done
hurry let's go home
Hotarun, want to hang out at our house? You won't come?
Fine, just for a little while though.
These are orange trees.
The new blossoms are growing?
The leaves, the type you garnish food with?
The store is where?
There is a co-op and a candy store.
Anymore?
the police box?
That's not a store.
Is there a bookstore?
The candy store sells magazines.
There is no convenience stores.
I've seen some commercials about them.
cows?
sometimes deer.
what's wrong?
This place is different from Tokyo.
Notice that the door was unlocked.
Today mom and dad are working.
Old sister, please grab for that me.
You should grab it yourself.
What's wrong ren-chon?
No sound is coming out.
No sound is still coming out.
Something came out.
A raccoon came out.
You own a raccoon? And it actually heard that noise?
I named it too.
What kind of name?
Gu
A psychedelic name
Gu will do a trick if I whistle again.
The whistling made a noise this time.
Gu will do?
Ren-chon
morning.
Ren-chon?
Do we live in the country side?
Where is this coming from?
Hotarun was  surprised by the raccoon, having different grades in one classroom.
My older sister told me you drive 50 km an hour, you drive 50 km in an hour.  It is amazing.
I see.
in one hour, you can't travel 50 km due to traffic lights.
In tokyo, there are some classrooms that combine elementary and middle school students.  There are no traffic lights.
Hotarun hello
good morning
nyanpasu~
hello
Ren-chon?
A raccoon lives at my house.  I think we live in the country.
You're still talking about that.
what are you talking about?
Is this really the country?
if you think about it logically.
Just because you live here does not make you a country girl.
that already makes you sound like a country girl.
You don't want this to be country do you?
If living in the country means you can't do anything, just having things like cows and raccoons doesn't make it inconvenient as well.  This isn't the countryside.
I see now. This is not the country.
Excellent, you're a good kid.
time to eat.
today's dishes were made with the vegetables that we picked.  Horsetail shoots,  wild udo, and tara sprouts.
it's tasty.
It tastes like spring.
Hotaru, save your blossom desert.
where are we going?
just a little further.
wait a second.....!!!
we were too slow.
when can we catch the next bus?
in two hours
what?
the buses are sure inconvenient.
Alright then!
